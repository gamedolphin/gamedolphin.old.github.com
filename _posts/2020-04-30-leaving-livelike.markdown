After 3 short years at Livelike, and a whirlwind of exciting projects, I am moving on now. Livelike allowed me the freedom to explore my interests while also teaching me how efficient systems that deliver are setup amidst the chaos. I am proud to have been part of the team that worked with FIFA World Cup VR coverage with multiple broadcasters by building over 30 apps simultaneously. I got to experience VR on the frontlines and ride the wave of desire for this technology. I also experienced intense sporting events up close, and got the best seats, albeit virtual ones.

It was a joy watching the team grow from a motley crew of a few trying to deliver at 4 a.m to a well-oiled machine that knows what is expected and how to deliver. I switched multiple teams and even led one for a short while. I made friends and I am thankful for this time at Livelike.

## Mini Livelike Resume

In somewhat chronological order:

* Created an android SDK out of a Unity VR project, got it to launch, and trimmed the size of the project. This never got good enough, given the structure of the project unfortunately.
* Ported the unity project into a Xamarin SDK, trimmed size down further with dynamic scene loading.
* Built a show-case for Sony products in VR.
* Ported Redux and Redux-Observable to C# Unity, built on top of UniRx. Proceeded to switch major chunks of the project to Redux based state management.
* Helped and watched over the DI-fication of the project, and eventual cleanup.
* Setup a rudimentary system for static assets to be switched quickly during the build to help with multiple clients.
* Unity side of the Mosaic system for watching multiple videos at the same time.
* Inherited and finished up the Highlight Center in the Unity application.
* Setup a React renderer for VR, allowing for the possible creation of VR applications with React. Used Spidermonkey for the JS engine, and got it to the POC stage.

## Why am I leaving?

Got an opportunity to do move away from app-related things back to a game-dev adjacent field and also to work with game-dev industry veterans. I was also getting quite comfortable at Livelike (and it is a *very* comfortable workplace**, so much so that I stopped growing and learning new things. The team has also reached a point where I feel comfortable exiting, the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is not one anymore.

ONWARDS!
