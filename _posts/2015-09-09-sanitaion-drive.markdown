Nearly 600 million people in India practice open defecation which causes chronic diarrhea that leads to stunting. 1,000 young lives are lost every day due to diarrhea. 1 With the objective of impacting knowledge, attitudes and practices around sanitation and hygiene-related behavior, Sesame Workshop India Trust supported by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, launched the Cleaner, Healthier, Happier campaign (Raho Swacch, Jiyo Mast) in November of 2014.
